There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [MSAL.js v2](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-browser).

Check it out: [JavaScript SPA secured with MSAL.js using Authorization Code Flow (w/ PKCE) on Azure AD B2C](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-b2c-javascript-spa)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the [master branch](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-javascript-msal-singlepageapp/tree/master), but please know that it's no longer maintained.
